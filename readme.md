was bored so I made this in an hour or so. there is no UI because UI takes time, and well, I didn't have THAT MUCH time.

it __should__ work with yt/yt music links.

might update later if I have spare time.

### setup
just clone the repo, cd into the directory, type ``npm i`` to install the required packages.
after that, run ``npm run start``.
then head over to http://localhost:3000 and the thing should be up and running.
change the port if needed.
