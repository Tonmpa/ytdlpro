was bored so I made this in an hour or so. there is no UI because UI takes time, and well, I didn't have THAT MUCH time.

so basically, it's a simple node.js server / front end that allows music downloading easily. it __should__ work with normal yt/yt music links. there is no optimization because I am lazy and tired.

the downloaded mp3 files get placed in ``downloads`` folder in the root dir.

### setup
just clone the repo, cd into the directory, type ``npm i`` to install the required packages.
after that, run ``npm run start``.
then head over to http://localhost:3000 and the thing should be up and running.
change the port if needed.

might update later if I have spare time.
